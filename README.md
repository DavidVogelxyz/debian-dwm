# debian-dwm

A derivation of Luke Smith's LARBS that works on Debian systems, with my added preferences.

I built some "module" bash scripts, tested them independently, and then created a "script of scripts" to run all the modules with one command. 

```
git clone https://github.com/davidvogelxyz/debian-dwm .local/src/debian-dwm

cd .local/src/debian-dwm

bash debian-dwm.sh
```

I imagine there are far better ways to build this installer. I plan to update this project as I learn them.
